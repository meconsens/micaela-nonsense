            <h2>Ph.D. Candidate in Computer Science at the University of Toronto (Moses and Wang lab)</h2>
            <p>I completed my undergrad in Computer Science, Bioinformatics and Biology at U of T in June 2021. I am currently a Computer Science Ph.D. candidate at U of T with a Focus in Machine Learning Applications for Healthcare in the Moses and Wang Lab. I'm interested in machine learning as a tool to investigate biological questions. Specifically, those whose answers could provide key insight into understanding human molecular machinery, and consequently into how we are ‘built’.</p>
